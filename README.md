# E-Commerce Data Analysis with Python (Dicoding Project)
## **Description**
This project aims to process and visualize data using various methods such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Streamlit dashboard to display data interactively. The project targets the analysis of an E-commerce dataset.

## **Directory Structure**
- dashboard/ : This directory contains a dashboard.py file which serves as the final outcome of the data analysis using Streamlit.
- data/ : This directory containing raw CSV data files.
- NoteBook.ipynb : This file is used to perform data analysis.

## **Installation**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Dappzz/data-analysis-project-dicoding.git
   ```
2. Make sure you have the appropriate Python environment and required libraries. You can install these libraries by running the following command:
     ```shell
   pip install streamlit
   pip install -r dashboard/requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**
1. Data wrangling & Exploratory Data Analysi (EDA) : Available in the Notebook.ipynb file, which aims to clean the data and explore it using Python scripts to understand patterns in the E-commerce data.
2. Visualization : Run the Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration with this code:
   ```shell
   cd data-analysis-project-dicoding/dashboard
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```
